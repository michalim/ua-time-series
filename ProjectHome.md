# Project Summary #

This project was formed while we trying to interpret different activities in [Wubble World](http://www.wubble-world.com).  Wubble World is a virtual environment with simulated physics, in which softbots, called wubbles, interact with objects.  Wubble World is instrumented to collect distances, velocities, locations, colors, sizes, and other sensory information and represent them with propositions such as `Above(wubble,box)` (the wubble is above the box) and `PVM(wubble)` (the wubble is experiencing positive vertical motion).

We recorded several different instances of the wubble performing an activity, like _jump over_.  The plan was to develop an incremental, on-line learning algorithm that would extract the _essence_ of the activity.

The algorithms in my dissertation are designed to work with _propositional multivariate time series_ or PMTS's.  Think of a PMTS as a matrix in which every row represents a proposition, every column represents a moment  in time, and every cell _(i,t)_ contains _1_ or _0_ depending on whether proposition _P_<sub>i</sub>  is true at time _t_.  Consecutive moments during which proposition _P_<sub>i</sub> is true are called the _fluent_ _P_<sub>i</sub>, as illustrated in the figure.

This software contains implementations of the algorithms discussed in each of the cited publications.  This software can be used to classify and recognize a wide range of activities, from handwriting recognition to simulated agent activity recognition.
